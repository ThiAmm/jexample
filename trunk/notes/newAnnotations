Dependencies between testmethods:

1. alternative: an Annotation Depends, which gets as parameter the name of the testmethod it depends on.
				eventually not only the name of the method, but also the class it is written in.
				
2. alternative: a method in the Annotation MyTest, like expected() in the original Test Annotation


Return values and parameters:

it's possible to annotate parameters, but "The values must be compile-time constants.", meant are the values
that an Annotation can get as parameter. so i think you can't say something like "the parameter will be the 
return value of the method the test depends on.
at the moment, i'm not really sure on how annotated parameters could help.

i'd rather allow normal parameters for a testmethod, if this method depends on another method and this other 
method returns the right Object.
