* DependenyParser: cope with primitive datatypes

* this thing with the descriptions doesn't work properly. if i take only the methods from the run class, there are so named
  unrooted methods, if i take the descriptions for all the methods and run all the tests and not just the source class, then all the 
  methods are in all the classes in the tree.
