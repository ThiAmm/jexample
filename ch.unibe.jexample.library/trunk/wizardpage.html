<P><span id="name">JExample</span> is a small framework to write unit tests that <i>depend on each other</i>. 
 Brought to you by Adrian Kuhn and Lea H&auml;nsenberger.
<P>
Dependent tests are not only more fun to write than isolated ones&mdash;they also run faster,
 reduce code duplication and provide better failure localization. How come?
 Given dependencies A, B and C had been executed successfully, 
 test T can reuse all of their fixtures.
 This saves both setup costs and code duplication.
 On the other hand, if one of the dependencies fails, test T and all its dependents are skipped. 
 This helps to pin-point failures to their very cause.

<H1>Release Notes</H1>

<P>r339, shows browser with release notes in add library wizard page.
<P>r337, don't clone transient field of references (ie weak and soft reference).
<P>r334, hidden developer flag, now possible to dispose cached test results
 when all their consumers (and co-consumers) are run.
<P>r332, fixed deep clone test (had to fix the dummy,
 since immutable objects aren't cloned anymore. Thus our test dummy now includes a mutable field).
<P>r329, don't clone instances of immutable classes (an immutable class has no, or primitive-immutable fields only).
<P>r328, if you deep-clone threads, bad things happen, thus we don't clone Threads.
<P>r327, all clone factories share the same clone strategy cache,
 this improves performance (before 24% of test running time was spent in UnsafeCloneStrategy#makeConstructor).
<P>r324, merged deep-clone branch into trunk. 
<P>Here starts prehistory&hellip; :)
