<P><span id="name">JExample</span> is a small framework to write unit tests that <i>depend on each other</i>. 
 Brought to you by Adrian Kuhn and Lea H&auml;nsenberger.
<P>
Dependent tests are not only more fun to write than isolated ones &mdash; they also run faster,
 reduce code duplication and provide better failure localization. How come?
 Given all dependencies had been executed successfully, 
 a test T can reuse their fixtures (ie return values).
 This helps you to save setup costs and avoids code duplication.
 If, however, one of the dependencies fails, test T and all its dependents are skipped. 
 This helps you to pin-point failures to their very cause.

        @Test
        public Stack emptyStack() {
            Stack stack = new Stack();
            assertEquals(0, stack.size());
            return stack;
        }

        @Given("#emptyStack")
        public Stack shouldPush(Stack stack) {
            stack.push("element");
            assertEquals(1, stack.size());
            return stack;
        }
    
        @Given("#shouldPush")
        public void shouldPop(Stack stack) {
            int size = stack.size();
            String string = stack.pop();
            assertEquals("element", string);
            assertEquals(size - 1, stack.size());
        }

<H1>Release Notes</H1>

<P>r378, fixed bug in immutable classes matcher.
<P>r374, writes dot file if "jexample.dot" system property is set.
<P>r372, @Injection annotation allows you to declare injection policy. Available policies are CLONE, DEEPCLONE, NONE, and RERUN, see InjectionPolicy's javadoc.
<P>r344, if "jexample.rerun" system property is set, we force all injection values (including the test class) to be re-created instead of cloned. 
<P>r339, shows browser with release notes in "Add Library" wizard page.
<P>r337, deepcopy: don't clone transient field of references (ie weak and soft reference).
<P>r329, deepcopy: don't clone instances of immutable classes (an immutable class has no, or primitive-immutable fields only).
<P>r328, deepcopy: if you deep-clone threads, bad things happen, thus we don't clone Threads.
<P>r327, deepcopy: all clone factories share the same clone strategy cache,
 this improves performance (before 24% of test running time was spent in UnsafeCloneStrategy#makeConstructor).
<P>r324, merged deep-clone branch into trunk. 
<P>Here starts prehistory&hellip; :)
